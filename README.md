# vim-disable-italics
A small vim plugin that disables italics in highlighting.

## Why?

Termux on Android fails to render italics properly, shifting characters slowly to the right until they are re-rendered. This removes italics from all highlighting, working around that issue.

## Acknowledgements

Thanks to u/TheDerkus on Reddit for the original code!
